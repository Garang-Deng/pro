# Responsive product preview card using CSS flexbox, variables, and media queries
Structure was created with HTML semantics and a bit of Accessibility. 
I used Variables to store images and colors,
Then aligned it with flexbox.
Media Queries was used to make it responsive to different screen sizes.
